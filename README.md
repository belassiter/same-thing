A web page to play the "Say the Same Thing" game.

## How to Play

The goal of the game is for you and your partner to say the same word.

1.  **Enter a word:** Both players enter a word.
2.  **Compare:** The words are compared.
3.  **Match?**
    *   If the words are the same (or have the same root), you win!
    *   If not, use the two words you just said as inspiration for the next round.
4.  **Repeat:** Keep going until you say the same thing!

### Game Modes

*   **Local:** Play with a friend on the same computer.
*   **Remote:** Play with a friend over the internet by creating or joining a private room.

## How to Run
